# roblox_islands_price_table
The file 'vending-machines.lua' is a script to be injected into Roblox to gather all information from vending machines located on a player's island into a CSV table (works only on 'pro' servers).

The file 'sort.py' consolidates all data from the previous program (from all scanned islands) and organizes them into a single sorted array. You can see an example of the result it could provide with the 'sort.csv' file (7600 items and their referenced prices).

This is intended to analyze the market trend and prices on the largest shops in Islands, enabling users to adapt their own prices accordingly.

However, I created this script quite some time ago, and I couldn't even say when exactly. So, I'm not entirely confident about the reliability of the program since it heavily relies on the structure of Islands' data, which may have changed. Also, as you can see in the code, it was developed on Synapse X, which has been discontinued, so it will require at least some tweaking. But, well, if it can help someone passionate about Islands :)
